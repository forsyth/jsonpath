Package jsonpath/paths provides a parser for JSONpaths, a syntax for expressing queries and locations in a JSON structure.

The JSONpath syntax is often defined by providing a set of sample paths.
Following https://github.com/dchester/jsonpath/, this package instead is based on a grammar,
Briefly, a JSONpath gives a dot-separated path through a JSON structure, with nested expressions providing dynamic values and filters.
For the detailed syntax, run
	go doc jsonpath/syntax


ParsePath returns a Path that represents the JSONpath provided as text.
That result Path, and the Steps and Expr trees it contains, can then be evaluated against a subject JSON structure ("document").

ParseScriptExpression parses a string that contains only a script expression (not a path) and returns the Expr tree. It is not normally needed, because ParsePath will parse any script expressions in a path string, but might be useful for calculating using values in a JSON structure.
